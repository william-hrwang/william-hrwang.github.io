# Welcome!

I am a Master‚Äôs student in the Computer Science Department at Western University. My research interest includes **Human Centered Computing**, **3D Computer Vision**, **Multi-modal Machine Learning**, **Computational Social Science** and **Health Informatics**. My work explores the intersection of computer science, data analytics, and AI applications, utlizing interdisciplinary approaches to enhance user experiences and healthcare outcomes. I am particularly interested in developing innovative solutions that bridge technology and human well-being. I am passionate about using emerging technologies to solve complex real-world challenges while ensuring solutions remain accessible and user-friendly.

In 2024, I worked as an AI4Education Research Assistant at the [Suzhou Research Institute of National University of Singapore](http://en.nusri.cn/). My research centered on leveraging AI to enhance educational outcomes, specifically in coding education and assessment. 

From 2023 to 2024, I served as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Soochow University, contributing to multimodal fake news detection via fine-grained semantic consistency [Guobiao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9063vvMAAAAJ). I helped designed and implemented a detection model integrating BERT for text representation, Faster R-CNN with an attention mechanism for extracting fine-grained visual features, and CLIP for global image-text alignment.

In 2023, I was honored to be selected for the [Mitacs Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/globalink-research-internship-students/), where I collaborated with Assistant Professor [Matthew Hamilton](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PWi6hlkAAAAJ&hl=en) in Memorial University of Newfoundland. My work focused on the Light Field project and enhanced holographic imagery simulation using CUDA parallel computing, showcasing my technical expertise and innovative problem-solving skills.

From 2022 to 2023, I collaborated with Associate Professor [Xi Cheng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xi_Cheng65) at Soochow University to explore the impact of Open Peer Review on Citations and Altmetrics. I utilized Python web scraping to collect extensive data from Nature Communications and PLoS One, employed an LM Linear Regression model in R to analyze the correlation between citation counts and time.

You can find my detailed CV here: [**William's Curriculum Viate**](https://william-hrwang.github.io/_pages/CV.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email. 

<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
